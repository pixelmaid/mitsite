	"blurb":"<p>Codeable Objects is a library for Processing that enables novice coders to rapidly design the form and aesthetics of physical artifacts using geometric computation, and then construct them through digital fabrication and hand-assembly. The programming methods provided by the library allow the user to program a variety of structures and designs with simple code and geometry. When the user compiles their code, the software outputs tool paths based on their specifications, which can be used in conjunction with digital fabrication tools to build their object. As an initial case study, Codeable Objects has been utilized in multiple workshops where users design and produce laser cut lamps.</p><p>The lamp version of Codeable Objects allows the user to use a combination of writing programing code and manipulating a graphic user interface to design their lamp. The application shows a 3d wireframe model of the lamp body along with a set of sliders that allow the user to adjust various parameters to customize the shape and size of their lamp. Based on the dimensions of the lamp as defined by the user, the software automatically generates a set of flat press-fit parts that when re-assembled will create the same 3d form. These parts can be previewed (and also parametrically adjusted) in another view.</p><p>A third view provides a preview of the ornamentation on the lamp shade. These patterns on the shades are generated by applying a voronoi diagram across a user defined set of coordinates, which are placed through textual programing methods in the processing IDE. THe software automatically clips the resultant pattern within the dimensions of the final body. Finished designs are exported as a set of three vector files: a part file for the wooden frame, a part file for the paper shades, and a part file for the paper ornamental frames which go over the shades. Once cut on the laser cutter, these pieces can be easily fabricated into parts which can be assembled by hand into the finished piece.</p>",
